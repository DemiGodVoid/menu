A simple hacking menu, made for education mother fuckers.


This is available on windows/Linux/Android and Iphone, However to get a better experience with no errors, Our team suggest using this menu on computer instead of mobile device (phone) due to ngrok not working on most phones. 

Please note, if you're using the menu on a phone then you might need to be rooted, As most of our features involve sudo. 

If you're caught doing illegal activities with this menu then our team will NOT be held responsible for your actions. Please get your victims consent before using any of the options provided to you on them.(EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE TEXT)

The menu is updated daily to weekly, Rather the update be large or small.

The update command does NOT work on phones, only on computers.
so if you're updating on phone, please use the rm -rf menu command and then re git clone.
